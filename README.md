# Pizza Ledger

## Description of the Project

Explain the main functionality and what problems it aims to solve.
My project is a simple, organized CLI application for recording transactions that are deposits, out-going payments,
and generate reports that are saved locally in a file.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to save my deposits/payments, so that I can have records of past deposits/payments.
- As a user, I want to have an option to view the deposits, payments, and generate reports so that I can see how much money I made or spend.
- As a user, I want to have multiple options for generating financial reports for different purposes so that I can easily file my taxes and meet other financial reporting needs.
- As a user, I want to be able to search records for certain vendors so that I can see how much I spent on a specific vendor.
- As a user, I want to see the newest transactions I made recently on the top so that I don't have to look for the recent transactions when displaying transaction.
- As a user, I want the flexibility to do my own transaction searching based on my criteria so that I can look for transactions with certain days, vendors, or amount.
- As a user, I want to receive visible feedback after I perform an action so that I know the app registered my input and I feel more in control.
